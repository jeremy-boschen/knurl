# Release Guidance Plan (2025-10-05)

- [x] Review existing release documentation (`RELEASE.md`, `SIGNING.md`).
- [x] Extract actionable release steps tailored for user guidance.
- [x] Draft final response summarizing the release workflow.

## Notes
- CI drafts Windows release on tag push; manual artifacts still possible.
- Checksums required per artifact; mention Windows WebView2 requirement in release notes.
