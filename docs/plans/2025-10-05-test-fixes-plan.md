# Test Fixes Plan (2025-10-05)

- [x] Reproduce failing tests to capture error output.
- [x] Diagnose root causes in affected modules.
- [x] Implement fixes and re-run targeted tests for confirmation.

## Notes
- Prioritize deterministic unit tests before integration.
- Avoid modifying generated UI components.
